= ASSmod 2.2 =
A Simple Server modification.

This is basically a server admin modification for Garry's Mod. It has a fairly
nice GUI and makes administrating a bit easier then some of the other admin mods
available.

== Access Levels ==
(in order of priority)
1. Owner
2. Super Admin
3. Admin
4. Temp Admin
5. Respected
6. Guest
7. Banned

== Usage ==
Simple bind a key to "+ASS_Menu". I generally use X since it's easy access and
isn't really used for anything else.

Example:
[code]
bind "x" "+ASS_Menu"
[/code]

=== Console Commands ===
The only time you should ever need to use an ASSmod console command is to assign
ownership of the server a player (or players) - This is only really needed on a 
dedicated server, or a server where more then one 'owner' is necessary. This
command is ASS_GiveOwnership <userid>.

Example:
[code]
] status
hostname:  The Hole
version : 1.0.0.0/7 3203 secure 
udp/ip  :  192.168.1.6:27015
map     :  gm_construct at: 882 x, -49 y, -79 z
players :  1 (8 max)

# userid name uniqueid connected ping loss state adr
#  9 "AndyVincent" STEAM_0:1:5014589 06:51 91 0 active 127.0.0.1:27005
] ASS_GiveOwnership 9
Ownership Given!
[/code]
The <userid> option is taken from the first column of the status report.

== Data Files ==
ASSmod keeps 3 files of data, and a few that are used for logging.
The log files are kept at around 20k so they shouldn't grow too big.
The 3 data files are kept in:
[code]
garrysmod\data\ass_rankings.txt
garrysmod\data\ass_config_client.txt
garrysmod\data\ass_config_server.txt
[/code]
The log files are all kept in:
[code]
garrysmod\data\asslog\ass_acl_ban_kick.txt
garrysmod\data\asslog\ass_acl_god.txt
garrysmod\data\asslog\ass_acl_health.txt
garrysmod\data\asslog\ass_acl_join_quit.txt
garrysmod\data\asslog\ass_acl_kill.txt
garrysmod\data\asslog\ass_acl_map.txt
garrysmod\data\asslog\ass_acl_notice.txt
garrysmod\data\asslog\ass_acl_promote.txt
garrysmod\data\asslog\ass_acl_rcon.txt
garrysmod\data\asslog\ass_acl_slap.txt
garrysmod\data\asslog\ass_acl_speech.txt
garrysmod\data\asslog\ass_acl_team.txt
[/code]
This is all assuming that you're using the "Default Writer" plugin
(the chances are that you are, it's the default setup).

== Plugins == 
It's possible to make plugins for this modifiation. Explore the "plugins"
directory. If you don't know Lua the chances are you won't be able to make 
any. Contact me if you need any information that you can't workout.

=== 1.52 - 17 Jan 2008 ===
* Removed: gmsv_asscmd.dll - It's causing crashes and is impossible
           to fix until VALVe release the ability to make mods
           based upon orangebox games. This means that commands
           such as sv_cheats WILL fail using ASSmod's RCON.

         beta and a dedicated server. Remove the DLL to fix
         the problem.
* Issue: The menu looks REALLY shitty in the beta. Re-write will
         be needed to make it use the sexy Derma menus...

            = true in your gamemode code).

       the default icon instead of one specified by the gamemode).

       by util.TableToKeyValues).

=== 1.22 - 18 Sept 2007 ===
* Addition: Prop protection plugin now stops players from using your
            props/entities.
* Bug: Fixed a minor problem with custom gamemode icons (it'd always use
       the default icon instead of one specified by the gamemode).

=== 1.21 - 16 Sept 2007 ===
* Bug: Fixed a typo in the sandbox limit plugin, which would cause Lua errors.

=== 1.2 - 16 Sept 2007 ===
* Addition: Added a gamemode menu item (this menu items takes the gamemodes name).
            Plugins can add to this item by hooking the AddGamemodeMenu function.
            (see the sandbox plugins for examples).
* Addition: Menu items now can have icons (the AddOption function returns a MENUITEM
            on which you can call SetImage(filename)). Icons are 16x16 in size.
            Thanks to Mark James for the Silk iconset.
* Addition: Sandbox plugins for changing limits, and prop protection.
* Change: Split in to 3 seperate packages: Full (includes all plugins), Compact

       the string to be cut off - actually a bug in Gmod util.KeyValueToTable)

                 what's happening).

=== 1.0 - 03 Sept 2007 ===
* Initial Release
